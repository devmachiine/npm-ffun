 possibly conflicting names not to use: f, fx, fn, fun, func ?

 [x] ff : fetch function async
 [ ] fi : get function now, non async ~ ff calls fi

 [ ] ffetch replaces 'ff(' with 'ff$(my_script_path,' \[target_script_path..\] not replaces, still exists.
 [ ] Parse out comments beginning on first line
 
 ## Node
 [ ] Use custom elements on first ff line, eg. #env:node,desc:raft implementation with bla..
 [ ] ffunction should end with .njs ?


 [ ] Replace place oriented function arguments with a single object/map
 [ ] Replace 'throw' with try type (and make try type module?)
