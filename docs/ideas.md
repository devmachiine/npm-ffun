 name ideas..
 source branch > hunt, rope, lint, ffetch, use, aquire, get, ff, defn, foo, reqf, ask, arc, draw, canopy
 dependency upgrade > reap
 tree reduction  > bonsai

 possibly conflicting names not to use: f, fx, fn, fun, func ?

 ff : fetch function async
 fi : get function now, non async ~ ff calls fi
